    "- State - Mutable data that flows through execution (messages, counters, custom fields)\n",
    "- Context - Immutable configuration like prompts, models, session details, or application-specific configuration\n",
    "- Store - Persistent long-term memory across conversations\n",
    "- Stream Writer - Stream custom updates as tools execute\n",

    "**Evaluations** are a quantitative way to measure performance of agents, which is important beacause LLMs don't always behave precitably — small changes in prompts, models, or inputs can significantly impact results. Evaluations provide a structured way to identify failures, compare changes across different versions of your applicaiton, and build more reliable AI applications.\n",
