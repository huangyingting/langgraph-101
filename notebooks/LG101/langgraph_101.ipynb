    "\n",
    "We've been using `create_agent()`, which is built on **LangGraph**. LangGraph gives you full control over agent behavior using three core primitives:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core LangGraph Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State** \n",
    "   - Shared data structure passed between nodes\n",
    "   - Represents the agent's \"memory\"\n",
    "   - Can include messages, custom data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nodes** \n",
    "   - Python functions that process state\n",
    "   - Each node performs a specific task\n",
    "   - Examples: call LLM, execute tool, validate input\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Edges** \n",
    "   - Define flow between nodes\n",
    "   - Can be normal (always go to next node)\n",
    "   - Or conditional (decide based on logic)"
